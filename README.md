dotfiles
========

This repo contains my dotfiles configuration. My main inspiration come from these repos: 

	[Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
	[holman does dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

Installation: 
- Run install.sh to install the necessary dependencies
- Run setup.sh to create links for dotfiles configuration

Structures:
- File ended with .symlink will be linked to your home folder
- File ended with .zsh will be symlinked to $HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom folder presumably you're using oh-my-zsh by running the install.sh script

My dotfiles repo are still in its crude form. If you want to have a more mature and sophisticated dotfiles you should clone the above mentioned repos. Or you can go to [github's dotfiles pages](http://dotfiles.github.io). In this case, I prefer to start fresh and gradually add in new configurations which tailor to my needs. Pull in a lot of customized implicit configuration at once won't help to boost my productivity in anyway.
